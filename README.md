# MenuSpinner
Spinner for the lunch menus.

These files include:

.xml and .java files for each cafeteria

the strings.xml which should be placed in app/src/main/res/values

Once Rav is done with the menus all that needs to be added is to put the menu images in the /drawable folder and then finish the ImageView lines of code for each cafeteria.
